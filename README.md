# ðŸŒˆ MacOS Colorpicker App Shortcut

A little applescript app to directly access the official Apple colorpicker tool.

## Why?

This little helper app allows you to open the color-picker without needing to do that. You can drag this into your Applications folder or dock and run whenever you like.
